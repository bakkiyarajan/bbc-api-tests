# BBC API Test Framework (JavaScript)

This project is a test automation framework built using:
- Cucumber.js for BDD
- SuperTest for API testing
- Chai for assertions
- Cucumber HTML Reporter for JSON and HTML reporting

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or extract the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the project directory 
3. Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:
```bash
npm install
```

## Run Tests
```bash
npm run test:full
```

## Test Scenarios Covered
- SC_1. Validate response status and time.
- SC_2. Verify non-empty `id` and `segment_type` should be `music`.
- SC_3. Validate `primary` field in `title_list`.
- SC_4. Ensure only one track has `now_playing` set to true.
- SC_5. Validate the `Date` header in the response.

## Project Structure and Folder Descriptions
### features/
This directory contains your Gherkin .feature files as well as the associated step definitions.
-	media.feature includes the actual test scenarios written in Gherkin syntax.
-	Inside step_definitions/, you will find mediaSteps.js, which holds the JavaScript code implementing the steps (Given, When, Then) defined in the feature file.
  
### util/
A utility folder for supporting scripts used in the test framework.
-	world.js defines a custom World constructor to manage and share test context like storing API responses between steps.
-	report.js is used to generate a readable HTML report after each test run, based on the JSON output.
 
### report/
This folder is automatically generated after a test run. It stores the test results, including the HTML report that summarizes scenario execution status.
-	cucumber_report.html can be opened in any browser to view detailed test output.

#### cucumber.js
This is the Cucumber configuration file that defines what files to include, sets up reporting formats, and controls test execution behavior.

#### package.json
Contains metadata about the project and lists all dependencies and test scripts. You can run the tests using commands defined here (npm run test:full).
